To be or not to be that is the question
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
To suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...


There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood 
leads on to fortune; omitted, all the voyage of their life is 
bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now
afloat, and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures.
